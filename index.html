    <p><h1>Google promises improved AI search results, as well as perhaps some photographs and movies.</h1></p>
    <p>Although Google's AI efforts haven't always been successful, it hasn't taken long for these programs to become a little more mature, which brings with it additional functionality and polish. The most recent improvements to Google's generative AI search results, which include both new features and improved performance, are being highlighted.</p>
    <p>The fundamental AI-powered overviews are expanded at the top of the list to incorporate images and videos within the text, thus combining the functionality of several search modes into a single block. In order to contextualize the animals or things mentioned in the results, Google plans to give photos to better illustrate the subjects of an AI result. In the same way, results that would benefit from motion rather than a static image will be presented as videos.</p>
    <p>Anyone who frequently uses Google for search is likely familiar with these functions, but this development reflects a development of the AI capabilities and may result in different outcomes from those of Google's standard picture and video search modes. Over the coming week, Google intends to begin rolling out photo and video embeds, but only for users who have signed up for the Labs project for generative AI results in Search.</p>
    <p>Since the outset, Google has prioritized providing context for AI results. This has been mostly accomplished by incorporating source links to the original source or confirming websites where information had been printed. Google, however, is now adding publishing dates next to links so it is simpler to determine how old content is and if it is still relevant, giving consumers additional context and allowing them to assess the timeliness of the results.</p>
    <p>Finally, after enhancing the effectiveness of AI overviews, Google is doing a little victory lap. The generation time has just been decreased in half, which results in speedier delivery to users. Naturally, this also means that server costs will probably drop by roughly the same amount, making it simpler to scale this to more people.</p>
    <p>I can't say that I've observed or had any issues with delayed delivery after having the generative AI search lab active for the past few months. I didn't notice a speed increase, and it's usually very fast. The conventional search results should remain on the page after the AI results have been provided and displayed, in my opinion, as this would greatly enhance the user experience. However, it's simple to see the outcomes of Google's efforts to improve the user experience with AI tools.</p>
